# 🧪 QA Checklist – Image Processing Stylization

## 1️⃣ Environment Setup
- [ ✅] Python installed
- [ ✅] Virtual environment activated (`venv\Scripts\Activate`)
- [✅] Dependencies installed (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)

## 2️⃣ Input Images
- [ ✅] Sample images added for testing
- [✅ ] System handles invalid or missing files gracefully

## 3️⃣ Output Verification
- [✅ ] Grayscale image generated
- [✅ ] Pencil sketch image generated
- [ ✅] Duotone image generated
- [ ✅] Pixelated image generated
- [ ✅] Soft glow image generated
- [ ✅] All output images saved in correct folder
- [ ✅] Output images have correct dimensions

## 4️⃣ Technique Verification

### Grayscale Conversion
- [✅ ] Image is truly black & white
- [ ✅] Pixel intensity values correctly represent brightness

### Pencil Sketch Effect
- [ ✅] Edges are clearly visible
- [✅ ] Image resembles a sketch drawing
- [ ✅] No excessive noise or artifacts

### Duotone Color Mapping
- [ ✅] Only two dominant colors present
- [ ✅] Color mapping follows grayscale intensity

### Pixelation
- [✅ ] Visible block/mosaic effect
- [ ✅] Fine details reduced
- [ ✅] Output image retains original dimensions after upsampling

### Soft Glow Effect
- [ ✅] Highlights enhanced
- [ ✅] Blending is smooth (not overexposed)
- [✅ ] Output image retains correct resolution

## 5️⃣ Preprocessing Verification
- [✅ ] Center square cropping applied
- [✅ ] Fixed-size resizing applied
- [ ✅] No distortion or unexpected scaling

## 6️⃣ Program Stability
- [✅ ] Program runs without crashing
- [✅] Handles multiple images correctly
- [ ✅] Optional: All pytest tests pass (if available)

## 7️⃣ Optional Extras
- [ ✅] Add screenshots of outputs for reference
- [ ✅] Record any bugs or inconsistencies in outputs

### 🐞 Bugs / Notes
- [✅ ] No Bugs. All outputs were verified manually and automatically, and all tests passed.
